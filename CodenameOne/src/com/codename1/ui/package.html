            Main widget package containing the component/container "composite" similar
            both in terminology and design to Swing/AWT.

        <h3>Component/Container Relationship</h3>
        <p>
            Containers can be nested one within the other to form elaborate UI's. Containers use 
            {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts} to arrange the components within. This is important
            as it allows a container can adapt to changing resolution, DPI, orientation, font size etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            A container doesn't implicitly reflow its elements and in that regard follows the direction of AWT/Swing. As
            a result the layout can be animated to create a flowing effect for UI changes. This also provides improved
            performance as a bonus. See this sample of {@code Container} animation:

            event handling {@link com.codename1.ui.events here}.
