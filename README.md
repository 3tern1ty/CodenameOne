# CodenameOne
Codename One allows Java developers to write their app once and have it work on all mobile devices. 
It features a simulator, designer (visual theme/builder) and ports to multiple OS's all as part of the hierarchy.

Codename One is a mature open source project and its roots go back to Sun Microsystems (2006) where one of its core underlying components was developed and open sourced. 

This open source project includes the libraries, native OS ports, resource editor & native VM code for Codename One.

You can learn more about Codename One and its capabilities at the [main site](http://www.codenameone.com) and you can read
