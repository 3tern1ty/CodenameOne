# ParparVM
## The safe simple & easy way to build native iOS apps in Java

<img align="right" src="http://codenameone.com/img/parpar.png" height="250">
ParparVM is the VM developed by Codename One to replace the defunct [XMLVM](http://xmlvm.org/) with which it was 
originally built. We took our extensive experience both in JIT's and native OS development and built something
that is both simple, concervative and performant. 

## Why Another VM for iOS?

There are many VM's on the market and a few open source ones but none of the ones that translate to C are actively maintained.

[J2ObjC](https://github.com/google/j2objc) is an excellent tool for porting libraries to Objective-C but it isn't designed
to be a full scale VM (no GC etc.).

The other VM's (Avian & RoboVM) are pretty impressive technically since they compile directly to ARM/LLVM bitcode. 
That is a very problematic approach:

 - While this is an impressive feat Apple doesn't officially support this route. That means that with every transition 
 Apple makes (64bit, bitcode etc.) hurdles occur. This isn't some theoretical issue but something that has created 
 serious stumbling blocks to such projects.
 
 ParparVM had a seamless migration to iOS 9 (no code changes!) and had a relatively easy 64 bit transition!
 By comparison RoboVM's CEO [wrote this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/robovm/OnE3moz3d-8/nba0ury5CwAJ):

> "Our work to add full support for iOS 9 in time for its public release was one of the most daunting challenges weâ€™ve faced in our existence" 

 - These VM's use the entire Android class libraries resulting in relatively large apps. They also take longer 
 to compile.
 
 - Xcode's tools can't be used to their full extent with such tools, with ParparVM you can just use Xcodes amazing
 profiler and related tools out of the box since all the code is C code
 
 - Hacking these tools requires some deep VM/ASM/LLVM knowledge. ParparVM is trivial by comparison and requires a bit 
 of Java bytecode knowledege and some C.


Besides these advantages ParparVM also embeds the a concurrent GC logic directly into the code, this is very similar to
ARC in some aspects. The ParparVM GC is concurrent and doesn't need to "stop the world" for typical code, its relatively 
trivial and written entirely in C.

## Performance

Since the Xcode C compiler is VERY fast the performance of ParparVM should be pretty good. However, it performs badly and
sometimes horribly in microbenchmarks. However, its performance in "real life" situations is generally very good.

### GC Overhead

Normally VM's separate the GC to a completely separate thread and disconnect from it. ParparVM doesn't do that and so
you end up with an overhead that is paid in user threads in order to reduce GC stalls. 

This is a price we gladly pay, it removes the UI stalls normally associated with GC code in favor of theoretical 
method performance. 

### Method Overhead & Stack

ParparVM uses code that mimics the JVM stack bytecodes, this makes the translation process very fast and simple. It
also makes the GC easy since the stacks are maintained "as is" but maintaining a software stack has a slight overhead
that prevents the compiler from truly optimizing away some cases. 

We have handcoded optimization methods that optimize away common use cases, e.g. getters/setters are effectively free
under ParparVM. But this work should probably be extended further.

## Relation To Codename One

ParparVM is used by Codename One internally, its open source and we have no intention to change that. 

Parpar has no dependency on Codename One itself that we know of.

## The Name

Parpar is a butterfly in Hebrew.

Initially when we worked at Sun and produced LWUIT we wanted to call it Morpho (butterfly) but marketing shot it down.
Unfortunately MorphoVM is already taken so we decided to go with ParparVM instead.
